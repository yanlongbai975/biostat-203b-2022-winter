*YANLONG BAI*

### Overall Grade: 154.5/180

### Quality of report: 10/10

-   Is the homework submitted (git tag time) before deadline? 

    Yes.
  
-   Is the final report in a human readable format html? 

    Yes.
  
-   Is the report prepared as a dynamic document (R markdown) for better reproducibility?

    Yes.
  
-   Is the report clear (whole sentences, typos, grammar)? Do readers have a clear idea what's going on and how are results produced by just reading the report? 

    Yes.
  
### Completeness, correctness and efficiency of solution: 107.5/120

- Q1 (10/10)

- Q2 (10/10)

- Q3 (20/20)

    Dr. Zhou uses `semi_join` 

- Q4 (10/10)

- Q5 (15/20)

    You forgot to group_by(subjectid, item_id). This would give us multiple rows per person but unique for each itemid. Then we'd use pivot_wider() to get one row per person, one column per itemid. `-5`.

- Q6 (20/20)

- Q7 (12.5/20)

    You didn't filter for (age at admission > 18). Further, your loop is very ugly here. Because your Q5 is wrong, your final columns are wrong here too. `-7.5.

- Q8 (10/10)

	    
### Usage of Git: 5/10

-   Are branches (`master` and `develop`) correctly set up? Is the hw submission put into the `master` branch?

    Yes
  
-   Are there enough commits? Are commit messages clear? 
  
    Yes
          
-   Is the hw2 submission tagged? 

    Yes
  
-   Are the folders (`hw1`, `hw2`, ...) created correctly? 
  
    Yes
  
-   Do not put a lot auxiliary files into version control. If any unnecessary files are in Git, take 5 points off.

    Do not put both RMD teaching server and non files in. `-5`.

### Reproducibility: 10/10

This HW might be difficult to check reproducibility. 

-   Are the materials (files and instructions) submitted to the `master` branch sufficient for reproducing all the results? Just click the `knit` button will produce the final `html` on teaching server? 

    Yes
  
-   If necessary, are there clear instructions, either in report or in a separate file, how to reproduce the results?

### R code style: 8/20

Each violation takes 2 points off, until all 20 points are depleted.

-   [Rule 2.5](https://style.tidyverse.org/syntax.html#long-lines) The maximum line length is 80 characters.  

    Line 239, 388, 431, 457, 515, 549 is longer than 80 characters. Store the long things in intermediate variables. 

-   [Rule 2.4.1](https://style.tidyverse.org/syntax.html#indenting) When indenting your code, use two spaces.  

-   [Rule 2.2.4](https://style.tidyverse.org/syntax.html#infix-operators) Place spaces around all infix operators (=, +, -, &lt;-, etc.).  

-   [Rule 2.2.1.](https://style.tidyverse.org/syntax.html#commas) Do not place a space before a comma, but always place one after a comma.  

-   [Rule 2.2.2](https://style.tidyverse.org/syntax.html#parentheses) Do not place spaces around code in parentheses or square brackets. Place a space before left parenthesis, except in a function call.
